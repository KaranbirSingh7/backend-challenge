## Backend Engineer - Coding challenge

This test is a part of our hiring process at crew.work for the Backend Engineer position. It should take you between 2 and 4 hours depending on your experience.

**Feel free to apply! Drop us a line with your LinkedIn/GitHub/Twitter and link of your code repository at [mohamed@crew.work](mailto:mohamed@crew.work)**

At Crew, we use mainly Golang but you are free to use any modern language/framework you wish. Here are some technologies we are more familiar with: JavaScript, Python, Java, Ruby.

> Threat this project as if you/we would continue working on this after your assignment: maintainability, scalability, and readability are super important.

## Goal

For this assignment, you are supposed:
- Load the list of talents exposed on the below API to a MongoDB database.
- Build a RESTful API based on microservices architecture. The API consists of the following endpoints:
  - Endpoint to list all talents from database.
  - Endpoint to add a new talent to the MongoDB database. 
- Write a CI/CD pipeline (CircleCI, GitHub Actions, etc) to test, build and deloy the API.

When you‚Äôre done, host it somewhere (e.g. on AWS Lambda, Amazon EC2/EKS, Heroku, Google AppEngine, etc.)

### API documentation

To fetch the list of talents, you‚Äôll need to make request to a publicly-available API to get JSON content:

```json
GET https://hiring.crew.work/v1/talents
```

The above endpoints will return hundreds of talents. You may break down or paginate the results into chunks to make the response easier to handle.

```json
GET https://hiring.crew.work/v1/talents?page=2&limit=20
```

The JSON response contains an array of candidates, each candidate has the following JSON attributes:

```json
{
        "id": "brr63adh5s5m7veepna0",
        "firstName": "Mohamed",
        "lastName": "Labouardy",
        "picture": "https://domain.com/picture.png",
